Resume classification helps recruiters efficiently screen large volumes of resumes using NLP techniques. Since resumes are unstructured and vary in format, manually sorting them is time-consuming and inefficient. By automating this process, companies save time, money, and improve productivity. 

NLP allows for extracting and organizing key information from diverse resume layouts, enabling fast and accurate classification based on job roles, skills, or experience. This streamlines the recruitment process, making it easier to identify suitable candidates. Despite formatting challenges, resume classification systems provide a scalable solution to manage and analyze resumes effectively across industries and hiring needs.

Project Components
1. Data Collection
Source resumes: Use datasets from Kaggle, GitHub, or scrape sample resumes (ensure anonymization).

      Labels: Make sure resumes are labeled with the correct category.

3. Data Preprocessing
Convert resumes (PDF/DOC) to text (use tools like PyMuPDF, textract, or docx).

      Clean the text (remove special characters, lowercasing, stop words, etc.).

      Tokenization, Lemmatization/Stemming.

4. Feature Extraction
TF-IDF / CountVectorizer

      Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT)

      Custom keyword-based features (e.g., frequency of "Python", "SQL" â†’ indicates data-related roles)

5. Modeling
      Traditional ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest.

      Deep Learning: LSTM, CNN, or Transformer-based models (like BERT fine-tuning).

      Use cross-validation and GridSearchCV for tuning.

6. Evaluation
      Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

      Consider multi-label classification if resumes can belong to multiple categories.

7. Deployment (optional)
      Deploy using Flask or Streamlit.
